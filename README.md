Energy Consumption and Prediction in London using EXCEL and POWER BI


# Energy Consumption Visualization Project

This project aims to analyze and visualize energy consumption trends across the 32 boroughs of London. It also includes a prediction model using Triple Exponential Smoothing or Holt-Winters method of Time Series Analysis to forecast electricity consumption from the year 2016 to 2025. The project follows the SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess) methodology for data analysis.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide insights into energy consumption patterns across the different boroughs of London. By visualizing the data and applying time series analysis techniques, we can identify trends, seasonality, and forecast future electricity consumption. This information can be valuable for energy planning, resource allocation, and sustainability initiatives.

## Data

The data used in this project is sourced from reliable energy consumption datasets for London. It includes historical records of electricity consumption for each borough, typically on a monthly or yearly basis. The dataset contains the following attributes:

- Borough: Name of the London borough.
- Year: The year of energy consumption data.
- Consumption: Electricity consumption value for the given borough and year.

## Methods

This project employs the following methods:

1. **Data Preparation:** The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and any necessary transformations. It is then prepared for visualization and modeling.

2. **Data Visualization:** Various plots and charts are generated to visualize energy consumption trends across the London boroughs. This helps in identifying patterns, seasonality, and anomalies.

3. **Time Series Analysis:** Triple Exponential Smoothing or Holt-Winters method is applied to the historical electricity consumption data to generate forecasts for future years. The model parameters and accuracy metrics are evaluated.

4. **Prediction:** The trained model is used to forecast electricity consumption between the years 2016 and 2025 for each borough. The predicted values are visualized alongside the historical data.

## Results

The results of this project include:

- Visualizations: Time Series graphs showing energy consumption trends across boroughs.
- Prediction Results: Forecasted electricity consumption values for each borough from 2016 to 2025.
